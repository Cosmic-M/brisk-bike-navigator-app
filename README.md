# brisk-bike-navigator 2.0

<h3>Project description:</h3>
Who doesn't like cycling or moto trips? There aren't only benefits for your health but a lot of<br>
interesting sceneries you can watch during your cycling time. Some new places of interest... which,<br>
maybe, you will like to visit one more time. This APP will be handy to use for such goals: just take<br>
a picture of an interesting scenery, add some description if you want, and it automatically will be<br>
saved into storage. If you have list of such places, it will be represented in Google Map automatically<br>
since you start this APP. Mind, you can combine a route using markers to obtain total distance to <br>
destination point. Also you can include transit markers. Expand your area of cycling and share<br>
interesting places with your friends!<br>
